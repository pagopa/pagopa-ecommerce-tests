# pagopa-ecommerce-event-dispatcher-service Integration tests repo

## What is this?

This repo contains integration tests for `pagopa-ecommerce-event-dispatcher-service` component.
Those tests populate target DB for simulate transaction in a given state and send events to queue triggering an action.
Finally perform checks against DB/queues to check that transaction is updated correctly and/or event is written to DLQ

Integration tests are written as junit kotlin tests. This allow pagopa-ecommerce-commons library re-use with events code
modifications that will be
reflected in those test too instead of hardcode it someway.

Spring boot SDK is used to configure queues and CosmosDB re-using what have been done for event-dispatcher-service

An example configuration of these environment variables is in the `.env.local` file.

(*): for Mongo connection string options
see [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/v4.3/fundamentals/connection/connection-options/#connection-options)

## Run the application

Set environment variables locally on the terminal with:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.example | xargs)
```

Then from current project directory run :

```sh
#install commons library locally in local M2 cache
./mvnw validate -PinstallCommons
#then execute tests
./mvnw test
```

## Code formatting

Code formatting checks are automatically performed during build phase.
If the code is not well formatted an error is raised blocking the maven build.

Helpful commands:

```sh
mvn spotless:check # --> used to perform format checks
mvn spotless:apply # --> used to format all misformatted files
```
